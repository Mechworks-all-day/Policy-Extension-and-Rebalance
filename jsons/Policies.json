//You might notice a distinct lack of Great Prophets in here; that's because they're in Piety/Rationalism instead.


//Classical Era
Piety/Rationalism, but without the former being utterly pants.

//Renaissance Era
Smaller general stat boosts vs stronger conditional ones.

//Industrial Era 
Exploitation vs Conservation. Former is good for gold, production, etc, latter is good for faith/culture strats

//Modern Era
Freedom vs Oppression. Former is good for a bunch of stuff, latter buffs military.

//Future Era
Only one here; Futurism, which adds some neat little boosters.
